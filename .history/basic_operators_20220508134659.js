// unary, binary, operand
/**
 * An operand -> is what operate are applied to 5 * 2, five and two are operand or argument
 * An operator is unary if it has a single operand or argument e.g the unary negation (-) reverses the sign of a number { let x = 1; x= -x result -1}
 * An operator is binary if it has two operands
 * **/

/**two operand example ***/
let x = 1,
    y = 3
console.log(y - x)
